<ul>
  <li>
    This repository contains a basic REST API built using Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL, all packaged with Docker for easy deployment and scalability.
  </li>
  <li>
    The API is designed with a monolithic architecture but can be easily converted to a microservices architecture if needed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Certain complexities, such as handling race conditions, managing share quantities in the market (considered infinite), and detailed buy/sell operations, have been intentionally omitted.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some statistical calculations for portfolios and portfolio shares have been considered, and the repository will be updated as I dive deeper into making the app more applicable to real-world scenarios.
