    This repository contains a basic REST API built with Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL, all packaged together using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.
  </li>
  <li>
    The API is designed with a monolithic architectural style, but its structure allows for seamless conversion to a microservices architecture if the need arises.
  </li>
  <li>
